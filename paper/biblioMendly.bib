  abstract     = {Partial least squares regression has been an
                  alternative to ordinary least squares for handling
                  multicollinearity in several areas of scientific
                  research since the 1960s. It has recently gained
                  much attention in the analysis of high dimensional
                  genomic data. We show that known asymptotic
                  consistency of the partial least squares estimator
                  for a univariate response does not hold with the
                  very large p and small n paradigm. We derive a
                  similar result for a multivariate response
                  regression with partial least squares. We then
                  propose a sparse partial least squares formulation
                  which aims simultaneously to achieve good predictive
                  performance and variable selection by producing
                  sparse linear combinations of the original
                  predictors. We provide an efficient implementation
                  of sparse partial least squares regression and
                  compare it with well-known variable selection and
                  dimension reduction approaches via simulation
                  experiments. We illustrate the practical utility of
                  sparse partial least squares regression in a joint
                  analysis of gene expression and genomewide binding
                  data.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new parsimonious version of the
                  classical multivariate normal linear model, yielding
                  a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) that is
                  asymptoti- cally less variable than the MLE based on
                  the usual model. Our approach is based on the
                  construction of a link between the mean function and
                  the covariance ma- trix, using the minimal reducing
                  subspace of the latter that accommodates the former.
                  This leads to a multivariate regression model, which
                  we call the envelope model, where the number of
                  parameters is maximally reduced. The MLE from the
                  envelope model can be substantially less variable
                  than the usual MLE, especially when the mean
                  function varies in directions that are orthogonal to
                  the directions of maximum variation for the
                  covariance matrix.},

                  it is possible to develop a common language which,
                  at least to a certain extent, can create direct
                  links and build bridges. From this point of
                  departure, the book will be of interest to the
                  following three types of scientists — statisticians,
                  quantum physicists and chemometricians — and in
                  particular, statisticians and physicists who are

                  first induced on the sample space, and then on the
                  parameter space. It is argued that the right
                  invariant measure induced by the group on the
                  parameter space is a natural non-informative prior
                  for the parameters of the model. The permissible
                  sub-parameters are introduced, i.e., the
                  subparameters upon which group actions can be
                  defined. Equivariant estimators are similarly
                  defined. Orbits of the group are defined on the
                  sample space and on the parameter space; in
                  particular the group action is called transitive
                  when there is only one orbit. Credibility sets and
                  confidence sets are shown (under right invariant
                  prior and assuming transitivity on the parameter
                  space) to be equal when defined by permissible
                  sub-parameters and constructed from equivariant
                  estimators. The effect of different choices of
                  transformation group is illustrated by examples, and
                  properties of the orbits on the sample space and on
                  the parameter space are discussed. It is argued that
                  model reduction should be constrained to one or
                  several orbits of the group. Using this and other
                  natural criteria and concepts, among them concepts
                  related to design of experiments under symmetry,
                  leads to links towards chemometrical prediction
                  methods and towards the foundation of quantum
                  theory. On suppose q'un groupe de transformations

                  approached through the group of rotations of the
                  eigenvectors for the x-covariance matrix together
                  with scale transformations for each of the
                  corresponding regression coefficients. The partial
                  least squares model can be constructed from the
                  orbits of this group. A generalization of Pitman's
                  Theorem says that the best equivariant estimator
                  under a group is given by the Bayes estimator with
                  the group's invariant measure as the prior. A
                  straightforward application of this theorem turns
                  out to be impossible since the relevant invariant
                  prior leads to a non-defined posterior. Nevertheless
                  we can devise an approximate scale group with a
                  proper invariant prior leading to a well-defined
                  posterior distribution with a finite mean. This
                  Bayes estimator is explored using Markov chain Monte
                  Carlo technique. The estimator seems to require
                  heavy computations, but can be argued to have
                  several nice properties. It is also a valid
                  estimator when p{\textgreater}n.},

                  we recapitulate the main results regarding the
                  shrinkage properties of partial least squares (PLS)
                  regression. In particular, we give an alternative
                  proof of the shape of the PLS shrinkage factors. It
                  is well known that some of the factors are
                  {\textgreater}1. We discuss in detail the effect of
                  shrinkage factors for the mean squared error of
                  linear estimators and argue that we cannot extend
                  the results to PLS directly, as it is nonlinear. In
                  the second part, we investigate the effect of
                  shrinkage factors empirically. In particular, we
                  point out that experiments on simulated and real
                  world data show that bounding the absolute value of
                  the PLS shrinkage factors by 1 seems to leads to a
                  lower mean squared error.},

                  Least Squares regression can be a challenging task.
                  The reason is that the construction of latent
                  components from the predictor variables also depends
                  on the response variable. While this typically leads
                  to good performance and interpretable models in
                  practice, it makes the statistical analysis more
                  involved. In this work, we study the intrinsic
                  complexity of Partial Least Squares Regression. Our
                  contribution is an unbiased estimate of its Degrees
                  of Freedom. It is defined as the trace of the first
                  derivative of the fitted values, seen as a function
                  of the response. We establish two equivalent
                  representations that rely on the close connection of
                  Partial Least Squares to matrix decompositions and
                  Krylov subspace techniques. We show that the Degrees
                  of Freedom depend on the collinearity of the
                  predictor variables: The lower the collinearity is,
                  the higher the Degrees of Freedom are. In
                  particular, they are typically higher than the naive
                  approach that defines the Degrees of Freedom as the
                  number of components. Further, we illustrate how our
                  Degrees of Freedom estimate can be used for the
                  comparison of different regression methods. In the
                  experimental section, we show that our Degrees of
                  Freedom estimate in combination with information
                  criteria is useful for model selection.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses two closely related questions,
                  "What is a statistical model?" and "What is a
                  parameter?" The notions that a model must "make
                  sense," and that a parameter must "have a
                  well-defined meaning" are deeply ingrained in
                  applied statistical work, reasonably well understood
                  at an instinctive level, but absent from most formal
                  theories of modelling and inference. In this paper,
                  these concepts are defined in algebraic terms, using
                  morphisms, functors and natural transformations. It
                  is argued that inference on the basis of a model is
                  not possible unless the model admits a natural
                  extension that includes the domain for which
                  inference is required. For example, prediction
                  requires that the domain include all future units,
                  subjects or time points. Although it is usually not
                  made explicit, every sensible statistical model
                  admits such an extension. Examples are given to show
                  why such an extension is necessary and why a formal
                  theory is required. In the definition of a
                  subparameter, it is shown that certain parameter
                  functions are natural and others are not. Inference
                  is meaningful only for natural parameters. This
                  distinction has important consequences for the
                  construction of prior distributions and also helps
                  to resolve a controversy concerning the Box-Cox
                  model.},

  abstract     = {An extension of chemometric theory was
                  experimentally explored to explain the
                  physiochemical basis of the very high efficiency of
                  soft modelling of data from nature. Soft modelling
                  in self-organisation was interpreted by studying the
                  unique chemical patterns of mutants in an isogenic
                  barley model on endosperm development. Extremely
                  reproducible, differential Near Infrared (NIR)
                  spectral patterns specifically overviewed the effect
                  on cell composition of each mutant cause. Extended
                  Canonical Variates Analysis (ECVA) classified
                  spectra in wild type, starch and protein mutants.
                  The spectra were interpreted by chemometric data
                  analysis and by pattern inspection to morphological,
                  genetic, molecular and chemical information.
                  Deterministic chemical reactions were defined in the
                  glucan pathway. A drastic mutation in a gene
                  controlling the starch/(ss)-glucan composition
                  changed water activity that introduced a diffusive,
                  stochastic effect on the catalysis of all active
                  enzymes. 'Decision making' in self-organisation is
                  autonomous and performed by the soft modelling of
                  the chemical deterministic and stochastic reactions
                  in the endosperm cell as a whole. Uncertainty in the
                  analysis of endosperm emergence was experimentally
                  delimited as the 'indeterminacy' in local molecular
                  path modelling 'bottom up' and the 'irreducibility'
                  of the phenomenological NIR spectra 'top down'. The
                  experiment confirmed Ilya Prigogine's interpretation
                  of self-organisation by his dynamic computer model
                  programmed with a self-modeled non-local extension
                  of quantum mechanics (QM). The significance of

                  analysis the development of new methods for
                  statistical inference and prediction is the focus of
                  many studies. The requirement to document the
                  properties of new methods is inevitable, and often
                  simulated data are used for this purpose. However,
                  when it comes to simulating data there are few
                  standard approaches. In this paper we propose a very
                  transparent and versatile method for simulating
                  response and predictor data from a multiple linear
                  regression model which hopefully may serve as a
                  standard tool simulating linear model data. The
                  approach uses the principle of a relevant subspace
                  for prediction, which is known both from Partial
                  Least Squares and envelope models, and is
                  essentially based on a re-parametrization of the
                  random x regression model. The approach also allows
                  for defining a subset of relevant observable
                  predictor variables spanning the relevant latent
                  subspace, which is handy for exploring methods for
                  variable selection. The data properties are defined
                  by a small set of input-parameters defined by the
                  analyst. The versatile approach can be used to
                  simulate a great variety of data with varying
                  properties in order to compare statistical methods.
                  The method has been implemented in an R-package and
                  its use is illustrated by examples.},

  abstract     = {This paper tries first to introduce and motivate the
                  methodology of multivariate calibration. Next a
                  review is given, mostly avoiding technicalities, of
                  the somewhat messy theory of the subject. Two
                  approaches are distinguished: the estimation
                  approach (controlled calibration) and the prediction
                  approach (natural calibration). Among problems
                  discussed are the choice of estimator, the choice of
                  confidence region, methodology for handling
                  situations with more variables than observations,
                  near-collinearities (,vith countermeasures like
                  ridge type regression, principal components
                  regression, partial least squares regression and
                  continuum regression), pretreatment of data, and
                  cross-validation vs true prediction. Examples
                  discussed in detail concern estimation of the age of
                  a rhinoceros from its horn lengths
                  (low-dimensional), and nitrate prediction in
                  waste-water from high-dimensional spectroscopic
                  measurements.},

  abstract     = {The use of partial least squares (PLS) for handling
                  collinearities among the independent variables X in
                  multiple regression is discussed. Consecutive
                  estimates (rank 1, 2,...) are obtained using the
                  residuals from previous rank as a new dependent
                  variable y. The PLS method is equivalent to the
                  conjugate gradient method used in Numerical Analysis
                  for related problems. To estimate the "optimal"
                  rank, cross validation is used. Jackknife estimates
                  of the standard errors are thereby obtained with no
                  extra computation. The PLS method is compared with
                  ridge regression and principal components regression
